    "## Using files to store data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've either hard-coded data into our programs, or we've allowed the user to enter it using their keyboard (with `input()`). Of course, if we want to work with larger data sets, we'll need a better way of getting data into and out of our programs. Python allows us to read and write to _files_ stored in the computer's _filesystem_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing data as files has a number of benefits. Files are persistent, so the data they contain remains even when your computer is switched off. They're also easy to share with others, allowing data to be uploaded for use by others. Finally, the computer's filesystem provides a built-in way of organising files into folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with files in other programming languages, you'll know that it can sometimes be tricky. We first need to open the file, by giving a _path_ to its location. We can then read and write to the file. And finally, we need to make sure that we _close_ the file once we're finished, so that all of the changes we make are saved properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, however, makes dealing with files much more straightforward:"

The `open` function returns an object that represents the file, and `as phonebookFile` assigns this to the variable called `phonebookFile`. We haven't covered objects in this track, but for now all we need to know is that we can perform operations (like reading and writing) on the file via the object assigned to `phonebookFile`. Finally, the `with` statement opens a block where it is valid to access the file via `phonebookFile`. The file will be closed once the `with` block has finished. That means that the above example safely opens the file, reads a line from it, and closes it.\n",

    "In this version of our `Car` class, we've made two changes. First, when we create the `registration_number` attribute, we've put an underscore in front of it (making it `_registration_number`). This is a convention that signals that we don't want code to directly access the attribute. Next, we've added a `change_registration_number` method. That means that we expect any changes to `_registration_number` to go through that method. This is useful for performing checks on updates. In this example, we make sure that we can't update the registration number to anything beginning with R:"
